## Introduction and Motivation

> * Economic circumstances
> * Public health
> * Medical care 
> * Industrial pollution

  The impact of AIDS is particularly notable on life expectancy in many African countries. The difference in life expectancy between men and women is also obvious. Therefore, we build this **Shiny App** to show the LEB of different country and gender.
